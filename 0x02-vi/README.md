- 4-undoing: The vi command to undo what you just did.
- 5-exiting: The command to quit vi even though the latest changes have not been saved for the vi call.
- 6-beginning_line: The vi command to move the cursor to the start of the current line.
- 7-end_line: The vi command to move the cursor to the end of the line.
